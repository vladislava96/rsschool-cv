# About me:
When I started my career, I decided that a job in the construction industry was not for me.
My fellow programmers told me about their work and it seemed interesting to me.
Having an engineering background, I decided to learn JavaScript and it turned out to be exciting, interesting, and the desire to learn new things does not disappear.
